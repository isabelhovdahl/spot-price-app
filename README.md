# Deploying Dash Application

This repository contains the material for the workshop on deployment in the course [BAN438 Application Development in Python](https://www.nhh.no/en/courses/application-development-in-python/).

In the workshop, we use the free version of the hosting plattform Render to deploy a Dash application online. The application is a spot price dashboard that allows users to explore the hourly spot price in the five different price zones in Norway for a given time period. You can see the live version of the application here: https://spot-price-app.onrender.com/.

Please see the slides for a step-by-step guide on how to deploy the app.
